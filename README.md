### Business Introduction
The airline industry is a service-intensive and highly competitive sector, where customer experience is critical for long-term profitability and brand loyalty. In a market where delays, comfort, and service touch points significantly affect customer satisfaction, understanding passenger feedback is essential for continuous improvement.

### Business Problem
Despite a robust service delivery framework, only 43% of the surveyed 130K customers reported satisfaction, while 57% expressed dissatisfaction. The airline seeks to understand:
What factors are driving negative customer perceptions, and how can improvements be targeted to enhance overall satisfaction and loyalty?

### Objectives of The Analysis
The objective of this analysis is to:
-	Analyze customer satisfaction across multiple service touchpoints (e.g., seat comfort, inflight services, baggage handling).
-	Explore satisfaction trends by age, gender, class, and travel distance.
-	Evaluate the relationship between flight delays and customer dissatisfaction.
-	Identify areas requiring service optimization to improve overall customer experience.

### Data Transformation and Analysis
To deliver clear insights, the following steps were taken:
1.	**Data Collection and Cleaning:**
- Source: Customer feedback surveys collected from 130,000 respondents across different travel segments.
-	Cleaning: Removed duplicate entries and harmonized satisfaction scales (combining “neutral” with “dissatisfied” to streamline binary analysis).

2.	**Categorical Grouping:**
-	Categorization: Grouped customer responses based on demographics (age, gender), travel distance (e.g., nearby, regional), flight class, and delay experience

3.	**Data Visualization:**
-	Gauge Charts: Used to represent volume of feedback for individual services (e.g., inflight wifi, legroom).
-	Bar & Donut Charts: Used to analyze satisfaction distribution across gender, class, age, and delay metrics.
-	Stacked Comparisons: Applied to display side-by-side satisfaction and dissatisfaction in travel categories.

### Insights
-	Service Performance: Core service areas such as seat comfort (447K), baggage handling (472K), and in-flight wifi (354K) received significant feedback—indicating their importance to customers.
-	Customer Sentiment: Only 43% of customers were satisfied, while 57% expressed dissatisfaction, showing a clear service gap.
-	Delay Impact: Business travelers experienced the longest delays (arrival: 23K; departure: 22K), correlating with higher dissatisfaction in this segment.
-	Demographic Insights:
     - Adults and young adults were the most dissatisfied groups.
     - Male and female customers showed similar levels of dissatisfaction (28%-29%).
-	Travel Class:
    - Economy passengers reported the lowest satisfaction (only 11K satisfied vs 47K dissatisfied).
    - Business class had relatively higher satisfaction (43K satisfied vs 19K dissatisfied).
-	Distance Factor: Nearby and regional flights had the most complaints, especially in terms of onboard services and delays.

### Recommendations
1.	Prioritize High-Impact Services: Improve performance in high-feedback areas such as seat comfort, baggage handling, and in-flight connectivity to boost customer retention.
2.	Delay Management: Enhance punctuality and communication, especially for business and nearby route customers, to reduce dissatisfaction.
3.	Personalize by Demographics: Create tailored experiences for adult and young adult travelers, including targeted loyalty offers and upgraded service options.
4.	Upgrade Economy Experience: Consider investing in comfort and entertainment in economy class, where dissatisfaction is highest.
5.	Real-Time Feedback Mechanisms: Integrate mobile-based real-time feedback tools to allow for faster service recovery and responsiveness.
